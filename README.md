## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind, making it easy for anyone to use.
- **Compressor Calculator**: Calculate threshold, ratio, and gain settings for optimal compression.
- **Delay Timing**: Get precise timing for delay effects based on your tempo.
- **Reverb Settings**: Calculate reverb times to match your audio project.
- **Mac Compatibility**: Fully optimized for Mac operating systems.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/RUSHALPATEL/compcalbyraftaar/releases). 

Once downloaded, execute the file to install the application on your Mac. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process.

## Usage

After installation, launch the application. The main interface will present you with options to calculate compressor settings, delay timing, and reverb settings. Simply input your desired values, and the tool will provide you with the necessary calculations.

### Interface Overview

- **Compressor Section**: Enter your audio input levels and desired output to get compressor settings.
- **Delay Section**: Input your BPM (Beats Per Minute) to receive delay time calculations.
- **Reverb Section**: Adjust the reverb parameters to fit your project needs.

## Calculations

### Compressor Calculator

1. **Threshold**: Set the level at which compression begins.
2. **Ratio**: Define how much compression is applied.
3. **Gain**: Adjust the output level after compression.

### Delay Timing

To calculate delay times:

1. Enter your project BPM.
2. Choose the note value (e.g., quarter note, eighth note).
3. The tool will calculate the delay time in milliseconds.

### Reverb Settings

For reverb:

1. Input the desired reverb time (in seconds).
2. The tool will suggest the appropriate settings based on your input.

## Examples

### Example 1: Compressor Settings

- **Input Level**: -10 dB
- **Desired Output Level**: -5 dB
- **Ratio**: 4:1

The calculator will suggest a threshold of -8 dB and a gain of +3 dB.

### Example 2: Delay Timing

- **BPM**: 120
- **Note Value**: Eighth Note

The tool will calculate a delay time of 125 milliseconds.

### Example 3: Reverb Settings

- **Desired Reverb Time**: 2 seconds

The calculator will provide you with suggested parameters for your reverb effect.
